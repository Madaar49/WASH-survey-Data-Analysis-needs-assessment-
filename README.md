# Data processing and analysis of the WASH baseline survey in Sierra Leone 2016

## The WASH survey 2016 data
WASH is an acronym for (Water, sanitation and hygiene). The Sierra Leone WASH portal is a comprehensive mapping exercise carried out by the Ministry of Water Resources (MOWR) and its partners in 2016. Over 28,000 public improved waterpoints across all of Sierra Leoneâ€™s districts and chiefdoms have been mapped during this period. The exercise constitutes a comprehensive update of the earlier mapping in 2012.
The original data was retrieved from [washdata-sl.org](https://washdata-sl.org/wash-data/) in 2022. Since then the data on the website has been pre-processed and updated. I used the previous version (raw WASH baseline survey questionnaire) because it require more cleaning - better for gaining more experience.

### Data and scripts
This repository includes the raw WASH baseline survey questionnaire,  pre-processing notebook and the post processed files. My initial idea was to develop a suitability predictive model to infer what type of water point is suitable in a geographical area. This work is still in progress, but I decided to showcase the processed data on a dashboard.
The data was processed using python, and the notebook can be accessed at [WASH_survey_preprocessing.ipynb](https://github.com/Madaar49/WASH-survey-Data-Analysis-needs-assessment-/blob/main/WASH_survey_preprocessing.ipynb).

### The dashboard
The dashboard was created using the post processed data, and hosted by the [The Africa GeoPortal](https://www.africageoportal.com). It can be accessed at [Sierra Leone water points Dashboard](https://africageoportal.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/912c78bb3e644e31a9976f847a4fd51a).
