In this session, we will introduce you to categorical variables in Python. We will be using a subset of data from the [General Social Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/norc/general-social-survey?select=gss.csv).\n\nThe following code block imports some of the main packages we will be using, which are [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html), and [Plotly](https://plotly.com/graphing-libraries/). We will also use [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/index.html) for a special type of categorical plot.\n\nWe will read in our data and preview it as an interactive table.
